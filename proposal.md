# Major Project Proposal

## Description
- a puzzle platformer game where you have to place your platforming abilities (eg a dash) on a grid in order to use them

## Needs To Have
- at least 3 different abilities that can be placed and used
- for each ability
    - unique physics effect
    - art/vfx for usage
- at least 10 levels for players to work through
    - variable block palatte
    - colour scheme
    - hazards (eg spikes)
- non glitchy and nice to control player movement
- puzzle elements
    - buttons, levers, doors
    - maybe more?
- level editor so I don't go insane making levels
- music/sfx

## Nice To Have
- actually good art
- level select screen
- some sort of game story
